I'm really stressed about thinking about post-graduation life.
Yeah, but I feel like everyone else has their life together. They know what they want to do and where they want to go. I'm just kind of lost.
But I feel so much pressure to have it all figured out.
I guess so. But it's hard not to worry about the future.
I guess I could start by making a list of my goals and then developing a plan to achieve them.
Thanks, JOY. I feel a little better already.

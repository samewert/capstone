I'm just feeling really stressed out about being away from home for the first time. I miss my family and friends, and I'm not sure if I'm going to make it here.
I know, but it's just so hard. I feel like I'm all alone.
I guess I could talk to my roommate, but she seems to be doing fine. I don't want to burden her with my problems.
Maybe I'll talk to my resident advisor.
Thanks, JOY. I feel a little better already just talking to you.

Hi JOY, I'm really stressed about my finances. I'm a college student and I don't have a lot of money coming in, but I have a lot of expenses. I'm worried about making ends meet and I don't know how to manage my money better.
Thanks for your advice. I'm going to start by creating a budget and making some adjustments to my spending. I'll also look into some ways to earn extra money.

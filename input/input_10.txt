I'm starting college next week, and I'm worried about making new friends.
What if I don't fit in? What if everyone already has their friend groups?
I'm not very outgoing, and I'm afraid that I'm going to be alone.
I'm worried about missing out on all the fun and experiences that come with having a good group of friends.
I feel overwhelmed by the thought of having to meet so many new people all at once.
I know I'm not the only one feeling this way, but it still doesn't make it any easier.
I'm looking for some advice on how to overcome my social anxiety and make friends in college.
I'm open to trying new things and putting myself out there, but I need some guidance.
I'll take advantage of online resources and social media groups to connect with other new students.
I'll remember that everyone else is probably feeling nervous too, and that making friends takes time and effort.
I'm going to be patient with myself and not get discouraged if things don't happen overnight.
I'm going to remember that college is a time for exploration and self-discovery. I'll have the opportunity to meet people from all walks of life and expand my horizons.
Thank you, JOY. That means a lot. Your support and encouragement are very helpful.

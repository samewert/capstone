JOY, I'm feeling really stressed and overwhelmed. I'm struggling to keep up with my schoolwork, and I'm not enJOYing myself as much as I used to. I'm worried that I'm burning out.
I'm constantly feeling tired and drained. I have trouble concentrating and sleeping.
I'm easily irritable and impatient with myself and others.
I feel like I'm failing at everything. I'm constantly comparing myself to others and feeling inadequate.
I have no time for fun or relaxation, and I miss doing the things I used to love.
I think my main stressors are my class workload and my extracurricular activities. I'm taking a lot of challenging classes, and I'm involved in a lot of clubs and organizations.
I feel pressure to maintain a high GPA and be involved in many activities to look good for college applications and future employers.
I'm having trouble managing my time effectively and prioritizing my tasks.
I feel like I'm constantly rushing from one thing to the next, and I never have any time to relax.
I'm not taking care of myself physically and mentally. I'm not eating healthy, I'm not exercising, and I'm not getting enough sleep.
I'm going to talk to my professors about my workload and see if there's anything I can do to manage my time better.
I'm going to create a schedule and prioritize tasks so that I can focus on the most important things first.
I'm going to set boundaries between my schoolwork and my personal life. I'm going to try to schedule time for myself to relax and do the things I enjoy.
You're right. I need to focus on the activities that are most important to me and that will help me achieve my goals.
I'm also going to try to set some better boundaries between my schoolwork and my personal life. I need to make time for myself to relax and recharge.
Thank you, JOY. Your advice is very helpful. I'm going to start implementing some of these techniques today.

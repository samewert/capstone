JOY, I'm feeling really stressed and overwhelmed. I'm struggling to keep up with my schoolwork, and I'm not enJOYing myself as much as I used to. I'm worried that I'm burning out.
I think my main stressors are my class workload and my extracurricular activities. I'm involved in a lot of clubs and organizations, and I'm also trying to get good grades in my classes. It's hard to balance everything.
I'm worried that if I cut back on my extracurricular activities, I won't be as competitive when I apply for jobs and graduate school.
You're right. I need to focus on the activities that are most important to me. I'm also going to try to set some better boundaries between my schoolwork and my personal life.
Thank you, JOY. Your advice is very helpful. I'm going to start implementing some of these techniques today.

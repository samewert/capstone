I'm having a hard time dealing with body image issues. I feel like I'm not good enough.
I'm always comparing myself to other people, and I never feel good enough. I feel like I'm too fat, too skinny, too short, too tall.
I know, but it's hard not to. I'm constantly seeing images of people who are considered to be beautiful, and I don't feel like I fit in.
So what can I do to feel better about myself?
I'm trying to do that, but it's hard sometimes.
I'm also trying to be more positive about my body. I'm making a list of all the things I like about myself.
I'm still struggling, but I'm trying.
Thank you. I appreciate your help.

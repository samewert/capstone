I'm feeling really stressed about my course schedule. I have so much work to do, and I'm not sure how I'm going to manage it all.
Well, I'm taking six classes this semester, and they're all really demanding. I have to write a lot of papers and study for exams. I'm also involved in a few extracurricular activities, so it's hard to find time to do everything.
I think it's just the overall workload. I feel like I'm constantly behind, and I'm worried that I'm not going to do well in my classes.
Like what?
That's a good idea. I'll try to do that this weekend.
I'm pretty good at staying organized, but I'll definitely make sure to keep my planner up to date.
That's a good point. I tend to procrastinate, so it's important for me to set deadlines for myself.
Thanks for the advice, JOY. I'll try to follow your suggestions.
Thanks, JOY. That means a lot.

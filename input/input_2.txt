I'm feeling really stressed about not fitting in at college. I feel like I don't belong here.
Well, I don't seem to have anything in common with the other students. They're all so popular and outgoing, and I'm just not. I feel like I'm always on the outside looking in.
I know, but it's hard not to compare myself to others. Everyone seems to have so many friends, and I'm just lonely.
I hope so.
Thanks. I think I'll try getting involved in some clubs.
Okay. I'll try.

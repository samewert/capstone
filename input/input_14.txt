I'm really struggling with an eating disorder right now. I'm not sure what to do.
Well, I've been struggling with anorexia for a few years now. I'm constantly restricting my food intake and counting calories. I'm also terrified of gaining weight.
What can I do?
I'm not sure if I'm ready to develop a meal plan yet. I'm really scared of eating more food.
Okay. I'm willing to try.

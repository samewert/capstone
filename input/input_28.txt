I'm really stressed about studying abroad. I'm worried about adjusting to a new culture, taking classes in a new language, and making new friends.
I'm worried about not being able to understand the language or the culture. I'm also worried about making friends and feeling lonely.
But what if I don't adjust? What if I don't make friends? What if I'm miserable?
I know, but I'm still scared.
But what can I do to manage my stress?
Thank you for your advice, JOY. I feel a little better now.

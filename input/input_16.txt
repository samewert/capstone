I've been exploring a new hobby recently, but I'm finding it difficult to stay motivated.
I started painting, and I really enjoy the process of mixing colors and seeing them come to life on the canvas.
However, every time I sit down to create something specific, like a landscape or a portrait, I feel overwhelmed by the blank canvas and doubt my skills.
My paintings don't turn out the way I envisioned them, and I often end up frustrated and discouraged.
This has made painting more of a source of stress than enjoyment. I want to recapture the joy I initially felt when I started, but I don't know how.
I know I should push through this creative block, but I'm not sure where to start.
I've tried looking at other artists' work for inspiration, but it often makes me feel even more inadequate.
I've considered taking a painting class, but I'm worried that it will be too structured and stifle my creativity.
I'm open to any advice you might have on overcoming this creative block and rediscovering the joy of painting.
I find myself comparing my progress to others who seem to be naturally talented. It's hard not to feel discouraged when I see their beautiful creations.
I'm willing to experiment and try different styles, but I'm afraid of making mistakes and ruining a canvas.
I'm hopeful that with some guidance and encouragement, I can overcome this obstacle and find my artistic voice.
Thank you, JOY. I really appreciate your help and support.

I've been exploring a new hobby recently, but I'm finding it difficult to stay motivated.
I started painting, but every time I sit down to create something, I feel like my work isn't good enough.
It's becoming a source of stress rather than enjoyment.
I know I should push through it, but I'm not sure how to overcome this creative block. Any advice?
Thank you, JOY. I really appreciate it.

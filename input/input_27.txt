Hi JOY, I'm feeling really insecure about my relationship. I feel like my boyfriend is better than me in every way. He's smarter, more popular, and more athletic. I'm always afraid that he's going to find someone better.
I know, but it's hard not to compare myself. He's always getting attention from other girls, and I'm always worried that he's going to leave me for someone else.
I guess I'm just not used to being in a relationship where someone actually likes me. I've been hurt in the past, so it's hard for me to trust people.
Thanks, JOY. I feel a little better already.

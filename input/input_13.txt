JOY, I'm feeling really stressed about my future career path. I'm going to graduate in a few months, and I still don't know what I want to do with my life.
I know, but it's starting to feel like everyone else knows what they're doing except for me. All of my friends have job offers already, and I'm still lost.
But how do I know what I'm passionate about?
I'm not sure if I have any real passions. I like a lot of different things, but I don't know if I'm passionate enough about any of them to make a career out of them.
I'm thinking about going to graduate school, but I'm not sure if that's the right decision. I'm worried about getting into debt and not being able to find a job afterwards.
I'm feeling really overwhelmed. I don't know what to do.
Thank you, JOY. I feel a little bit better already.

JOY, I'm feeling really stressed about my future career path. I'm going to graduate in a few months, and I still don't know what I want to do with my life.
I know, but it's starting to feel like everyone else knows what they're doing except for me. All of my friends have job offers already, and I'm still lost.
But how do I know what I'm passionate about?
I'm not sure if I have any real passions. I like a lot of different things, but I don't know if I'm passionate enough about any of them to make a career out of them.
I'm thinking about going to graduate school, but I'm not sure if that's the right decision. I'm worried about getting into debt and not being able to find a job afterwards.
I'm feeling really overwhelmed. I don't know what to do.
I know, but it's starting to feel like everyone else knows what they're doing except for me. All of my friends have job offers already, and I'm still lost.
I've tried taking career assessments and personality tests, but they haven't provided any clear direction.
I could try reflecting on the activities I enjoy, the causes I care about, and the skills I want to develop.
Talking to people in different fields could help me learn more about various careers and discover potential passions.
I'm afraid of making the wrong decision and regretting it later.
I find it hard to focus on my studies and other responsibilities due to the stress of my uncertain future.
Thank you, JOY. I feel a little bit better already.

I'm feeling really stressed about my academic performance. My parents have really high expectations for me, and I'm afraid of letting them down.
I know, but it's hard. My parents are always asking me about my grades and my classes. They want me to go to a top law school, and I'm not sure if I'm good enough.
I guess I can try that. But I'm still worried about letting my parents down.
I see my classmates studying constantly and effortlessly achieving high grades, and it makes me feel insecure about my own abilities.
I compare myself to others all the time, and it's a recipe for disaster. It's hard to focus on my own journey when I'm constantly looking at everyone else's.
I try to cope with the pressure by studying long hours, but it's starting to take a toll on my mental and physical health.
I have a hard time talking about my feelings with my parents, so I usually bottle them up inside.
I'm worried that if I don't get into a top law school, they'll be disappointed in me and think I'm a failure.
I'm going to talk to my parents about their expectations and how they're affecting me. I need to set some boundaries and have an honest conversation.
Thank you, JOY. I really appreciate your advice.

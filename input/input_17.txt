I'm feeling really stressed about my academic performance. My parents have really high expectations for me, and I'm afraid of letting them down.
I know, but it's hard. My parents are always asking me about my grades and my classes. They want me to go to a top law school, and I'm not sure if I'm good enough.
I guess I can try that. But I'm still worried about letting my parents down.
Thank you, JOY. I really appreciate your advice.

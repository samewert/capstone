Hi, JOY. I'm feeling really stressed about managing my time in college. I have so much to do, and I'm not sure how to keep up.
Like what?
I guess I've been trying to wing it, which is probably not the best idea.
Okay, I'll try that.
I'm not sure how to prioritize my tasks.
That makes sense.
I've been putting off a big research paper because it seems so daunting. But maybe if I break it down into smaller tasks, it won't be so bad.
I guess I've been trying to do everything myself, which is probably not the best strategy.
Okay, I'll try to delegate some of my work to my classmates or friends.
I'm definitely not good at taking breaks. But I know it's important.
Thanks for the advice, JOY. I'll try to follow your tips.
Okay, I will. Thanks again.

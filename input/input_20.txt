I've been feeling really lonely lately.
Well, I don't really have any close friends here. Everyone seems to have their own group of friends already, and I feel like I just don't fit in. I've tried to join a few clubs, but I just feel awkward and out of place.
I know, but it's still hard. I miss my friends from home, and I just want to feel like I belong here.
I don't know. I just feel so lost and alone right now.
Thank you. That means a lot.
I like to read, write, and play music. I also enJOY spending time outdoors.
That's a good idea. I'll think about it.
Thank you, JOY. I really appreciate it.

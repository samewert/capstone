I'm so worried about my future career. I don't know what I want to do with my life, and I'm afraid of making the wrong decision.
I guess that makes me feel a little better. But I'm still really scared. I don't want to make a decision that I'll regret later.
But how do I know what I'm passionate about? I've tried so many different things, but nothing really seems to stick.
Thanks, JOY. That's really helpful. I feel a little bit better now.

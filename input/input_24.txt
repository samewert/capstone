I'm having trouble managing my long-distance relationship while in college. I miss my boyfriend so much, and it's hard to feel connected to him when we're so far apart.
But how? I feel like I'm doing everything wrong.
But what are some things we can do?
Those are all great tips. I'll try to implement them more in my relationship.
Thank you, JOY. I feel much better now.

I'm having trouble managing my long-distance relationship while in college. I miss my boyfriend so much, and it's hard to feel connected to him when we're so far apart.
I feel lonely and isolated, especially when surrounded by other couples on campus.
The time difference makes it difficult to communicate effectively and schedule video calls.
I constantly compare my relationship to others and feel like mine is somehow less valid.
I feel like I'm doing everything wrong. I try to communicate often, send thoughtful messages, and plan virtual dates, but it still feels insufficient.
I'm constantly doubting myself and our relationship. What if the distance is too much to overcome?
I'm worried about losing trust and intimacy due to the lack of physical interaction.
Can we set realistic expectations and develop a plan for maintaining our relationship long-distance?
Is there anything else I can do to feel more secure and confident in our relationship?
Those are all great tips, JOY. I'll try to implement them more in my relationship.
I'm feeling more optimistic now. Knowing there are things we can do to make things better gives me hope.
I'm committed to putting in the effort and making our relationship work, despite the challenges.
I understand that long-distance relationships require additional effort and communication, but the reward of being together is worth it.
Thank you, JOY. I feel much better now, knowing I have resources and support to navigate this challenging situation.

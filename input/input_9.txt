I've been struggling with substance abuse lately, JOY. I'm not sure what to do.
I feel like I'm losing control of my life. My grades are slipping, and I'm not spending time with my friends anymore. All I want to do is drink.
I don't know what to do anymore.
I've been feeling a lot of pressure lately. I'm trying to keep up with my classes, my job, and my social life. It's all too much sometimes.
I've tried some relaxation techniques, but I haven't been consistent with them. I guess I don't always make time for them.
I'll try to be more consistent with my relaxation techniques.
I have a few close friends, but I haven't told them about my substance abuse. I'm afraid they'll think I'm a bad person.
I think I might be ready to talk to a therapist.
Thank you, JOY. I really appreciate your help.

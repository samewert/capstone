I'm feeling a lot of pressure to choose a major. I don't know what I want to do with my life, and I'm worried that I'm going to make the wrong decision.
I feel overwhelmed by the different major options. There are so many choices, and I don't know where to start.
But I don't know what I'm interested in. I'm not really good at anything, and I don't know what to do with my life.
I feel pressured to choose something practical, something that will lead to a good job. But I also want to choose something I'm passionate about.
But I don't want to waste time. I want to graduate on time and get a good job.
I know. But it's so hard to decide. I feel like I'm lost.
I'm starting to feel lost and hopeless. I don't know what I want out of life, and I don't know how to figure it out.
I'm trying to explore different interests and try new things. I'm hoping to discover something I'm passionate about.
I've made an appointment with a career counselor to get some personalized advice.
I know that choosing a major is a big decision, but I'm determined to find the right path for me.
I know that I have the potential to succeed in whatever I choose, and I'm confident that I will find my way.
Thank you, JOY. I appreciate your help.

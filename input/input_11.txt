I'm feeling a lot of pressure to choose a major. I don't know what I want to do with my life, and I'm worried that I'm going to make the wrong decision.
But I don't know what I'm interested in. I'm not really good at anything, and I don't know what to do with my life.
But I don't want to waste time. I want to graduate on time and get a good job.
I know. But it's so hard to decide. I feel like I'm lost.
Thank you, JOY. I appreciate your help.

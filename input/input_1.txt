I'm feeling really inadequate as a college freshman. I feel like I don't belong here. Everyone else seems to have it all figured out.
But I feel like I'm falling behind. I'm struggling in my classes and I don't know how to make friends.
But I don't know how.
But I feel like I'm not good enough.
But I don't feel like it.
But how do I do that?
I'm good at writing and I like to help people.
I'll try that.
Thank you, JOY. I needed to hear that.

Hi JOY. I’m struggling with feelings of depression. I’m not sure what to do.
I feel overwhelmed by sadness and hopelessness. Everything feels pointless and difficult.
I have lost interest in activities I used to enjoy and find it hard to concentrate or make decisions.
I feel isolated and alone, even when surrounded by people.
Is there anything I can do to help myself feel better?
I’ve heard about therapy and medication, but I’m not sure if they’re right for me.
What are some other things I can try to manage my depression and improve my mood?
I’m worried about the impact this is having on my relationships and work.
I’m starting to feel hopeless and wonder if things will ever get better.
I’m surrounded by people who care about me and want to help.
I’m grateful for the resources available to me, including therapy and medication.
I’m not sure what the future holds, but I’m determined to keep fighting for my well-being.
I’m hopeful that with the right support and treatment, I can reclaim my life and find joy again.
Thank you, JOY, for your support and understanding. It means the world to me.

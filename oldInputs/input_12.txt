Hi JOY. I’m struggling with feelings of depression. I’m not sure what to do.
Thank you. I feel a little better already.
I’ve been feeling really down lately. I don’t have any motivation to do anything. I’m not sleeping well, and I don’t enJOY the things I used to.
Thank you. I appreciate that.
I’m not sure. I guess I just want to feel better. I want to be able to enJOY my life again.
Okay.
Thank you.

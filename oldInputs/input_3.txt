I'm struggling with my sexuality, JOY. I've always considered myself to be straight, but lately I've been questioning that. I'm attracted to men, but I'm also attracted to women. I'm not sure what to do.
But I'm so confused. I don't know what I'm feeling.
But I feel like I'm the only one who's feeling this way.
But what do I do now?
I don't know if I'm ready to talk to anyone about this yet.
But I don't know what to do.
Okay.
No, I think that's all. Thank you for listening to me, JOY.

I've been feeling really guilty about my academic performance lately. I'm not getting the grades I want, and I feel like I'm letting myself and my family down.
But I feel like I'm not trying hard enough. I'm spending hours studying, but it's not paying off.
I know, but I still feel guilty. I feel like I'm not good enough.
But what if I'm not smart enough? What if I never succeed?
Thank you. I needed to hear that.
I appreciate that.
I don't know. I guess I just need to remind myself that I'm doing my best.
I guess I could do that.
I'll try.

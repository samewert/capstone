I've been feeling homesick lately.
Yeah, it's just been hard to adjust to my new life here. I miss my family and friends a lot.
I know, but it's still hard to deal with. I feel like I don't belong here.
I guess so. But I'm worried that I'll never feel at home here.
How can I overcome it?
I've been thinking about talking to my resident assistant.
Okay, I'll talk to her tonight.
Thank you for your help, JOY. I really appreciate it.

I'm feeling a lot of pressure from my leadership roles in clubs and organizations. I'm not sure how to handle it all.
I have to juggle a lot of different deadlines and commitments. I'm also worried about making decisions that will affect other people.
I guess I could. I've been hesitant to do that in the past, but I'm starting to realize that I can't do everything myself.
Another thing that's causing me stress is making decisions. I'm worried about making the wrong decision and letting people down.
I guess you're right. I just need to be more confident in my decision-making abilities.
I think that's a good idea. I'm also going to try to delegate more tasks and to trust my team members.
Thank you, JOY. I appreciate your support.

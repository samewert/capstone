Hi JOY, I'm really struggling with anxiety lately. I feel like I'm constantly on edge, and it's making it hard for me to focus on my studies and social life.
Thanks, JOY. I'm not sure where to start.
I feel anxious about a lot of things, but especially about upcoming exams and presentations. I also get anxious when I have to socialize with new people.
I've tried a few things, like deep breathing and meditation. I've also tried to exercise regularly and get enough sleep. But it doesn't seem to be enough.
What are those?
That sounds interesting. I'm open to trying anything.
Thank you, JOY. I really appreciate your help.

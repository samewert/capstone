Hi, JOY. I'm really stressed out about my GPA. I'm trying to maintain a high GPA, but it's really hard. I feel like I'm always studying, and I'm still not getting the grades I want.
I want to get at least a 4.0 GPA. I know that's really ambitious, but I want to go to a good law school, and I know I need a high GPA to do that.
I know, but I feel like if I don't get a 4.0 GPA, I won't be successful.
I know, but I still feel like my GPA is the most important thing.
I know. I just don't know how to do that.
Okay.
That's a good idea. I'll try that.
I'll try to find a study buddy.
I'll try to do that.
I'll try to do that too.
Thank you, JOY. I feel better already.

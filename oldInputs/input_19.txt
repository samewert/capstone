I'm feeling really stressed about deciding whether or not to study abroad. I know it's a great opportunity, but I'm also worried about leaving my friends and family behind.
Yeah. I keep going back and forth. I'm excited about the idea of experiencing a new culture and meeting new people, but I'm also scared of the unknown.
I'm really interested in learning more about Japanese culture. I've been studying Japanese for a few years now, and I would love to have the opportunity to practice it in a real-world setting. I'm also excited to meet new people from all over the world.
I'm worried about missing my friends and family. I'm also worried about the cost of studying abroad. And I'm a little nervous about adjusting to a new culture and language.
I know. I'm just feeling really overwhelmed right now.
Thank you, JOY. I appreciate that.

I'm struggling with feelings of self-doubt. I feel like I'm not good enough and that I'm going to fail.
But I feel like my self-doubt is holding me back. I'm afraid to try new things because I'm scared of failing.
But how do I do that? How do I overcome my self-doubt?
I think my biggest trigger is when I compare myself to other people. I always feel like everyone else is smarter and more talented than me.
But it's hard not to compare myself to others. Everyone else seems to have their lives together, and I'm just struggling to keep up.
I'm trying, but it's not easy.
Thank you. I appreciate that.

It's a big decision to go to graduate school, and it's important to weigh the pros and cons carefully before making a decision.\n\nOne of the things you mentioned is that you're worried about getting into debt. This is a valid concern, as graduate school can be expensive. However, there are many ways to finance your education, such as scholarships, grants, and loans. You can also work part-time or full-time while you're in school to help pay for your expenses.\n\nAnother thing you mentioned is that you're worried about not being able to find a job afterwards. This is also a valid concern, as the job market can be competitive. However, if you choose a graduate program that is in high demand, you'll be more likely to find a job after you graduate.\n\nUltimately, the decision of whether or not to go to graduate school is a personal one. There is no right or wrong answer. However, I encourage you to do your research and weigh the pros and cons carefully before making a decision.\n\nHere are some additional resources that you may find helpful:\n\n* [The Pros and Cons of Going to Graduate School](https://www.usnews.com/education/blogs/the-grad-school-spotlight/articles/the-pros-and-cons-of-going-to-graduate-school)\n* [How to Finance Your Graduate Education](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/loans/student-loans/how-to-finance-graduate-school)\n* [How to Choose a Graduate Program](https://www.gradschoolhub.com/how-to-choose-a-graduate-program/)"]'

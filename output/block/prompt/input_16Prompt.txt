It's important to remember that everyone experiences setbacks, and it's how you deal with them that matters. Here are a few tips that might help you stay motivated:\n\n* **Set realistic goals.** Don't try to do too much too soon, or you'll quickly get discouraged. Start with small, achievable goals, and gradually increase the difficulty as you progress.\n* **Find a support system.** Having friends or family who are also interested in your hobby can help you stay motivated. You can share your progress, celebrate your successes, and vent about your frustrations.\n* **Make it fun!** Hobbies are supposed to be enjoyable, so make sure you're choosing something that you actually enjoy doing. If you're not having fun, you're less likely to stick with it.\n* **Don't give up.** Everyone experiences setbacks, but it's important to remember that everyone is different. Just because someone else was able to pick up a new hobby and stick with it doesn't mean that you will be able to do the same. The important thing is to keep trying, and eventually you'll find something that you're passionate about and that you can stick with."]'

This way, you'll have the freedom to experiment within a specific framework. You could also try taking a class with a teacher who encourages students to experiment and explore their own creativity."]'

This could mean trying a new art medium, taking a class, or reading about a different artist. Getting out of your comfort zone can help you to see things in a new way and spark new ideas.\n* **Don't be afraid to ask for help.** If you're really struggling, don't be afraid to ask for help from a friend, family member, or mentor. Sometimes, all you need is someone to talk to and help you to see your work in a new light.\n\nI hope these tips help! Remember, everyone experiences creative blocks. The key is to not give up.

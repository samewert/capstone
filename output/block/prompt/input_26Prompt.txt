What are some of the specific things that are making you feel stressed?\n\nYou mentioned that you have to juggle a lot of different deadlines and commitments. This can be a challenge, especially when you're also worried about making decisions that will affect other people. It's important to remember that you can't always please everyone, and that it's okay to make mistakes. Just do your best to make decisions that you think are in the best interests of the group, and don't be afraid to ask for help if you need it.\n\nHere are a few tips that might help you manage your stress:\n\n* **Set priorities.** Make a list of all the things you need to do, and then rank them in order of importance. This will help you focus on the most important tasks and avoid feeling overwhelmed.\n* **Delegate tasks.** If you have too much on your plate, don't be afraid to delegate tasks to others. This can free up your time and allow you to focus on the things that are most important to you.\n* **Take breaks.** It's important to take breaks throughout the day, even if it's just for a few minutes. This will help you stay refreshed and focused.\n* **Get enough sleep.** When you're sleep-deprived, you're more likely to feel stressed and overwhelmed. Make sure you're getting enough sleep each night so that you can function at your best.\n* **Talk to someone.** If you're feeling overwhelmed, talk to a friend, family member, or therapist. Talking about your problems can help you feel better and develop strategies for coping with stress."]'

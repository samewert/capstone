What are some of the specific things that are making you feel stressed?\n\nYou mentioned that you have to juggle a lot of different deadlines and commitments. That can be really challenging, especially when you're also worried about making decisions that will affect other people. It's important to remember that you can't always please everyone, and that it's okay to make mistakes. Just do your best to make decisions that you think are in the best interests of the group, and don't be afraid to ask for help if you need it.\n\nHere are a few things that you can do to help manage your stress:\n\n* **Set priorities.** Make a list of all of your tasks and commitments, and then rank them in order of importance. This will help you to focus on the most important things and avoid feeling overwhelmed.\n* **Delegate tasks.** If you have too much on your plate, don't be afraid to delegate tasks to others. This can free up your time and allow you to focus on the things that you're best at.\n* **Take breaks.** It's important to take breaks throughout the day, even if it's just for a few minutes. This will help you to stay refreshed and focused.\n* **Get enough sleep.** When you're sleep-deprived, you're more likely to feel stressed and overwhelmed. Make sure to get at least 7-8 hours of sleep each night.\n* **Eat healthy foods.** Eating a healthy diet can help to improve your mood and energy levels. This can make it easier to deal with stress.\n* **Exercise regularly.** Exercise is a great way to relieve stress and improve your overall health. Make sure to get at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise most days of the week.\n* **Spend time with loved ones.** Spending time with loved ones can help to reduce stress and make you feel supported. Make sure to schedule time for social activities each week.\n* **Seek professional help.** If you're feeling overwhelmed by stress, it's important to seek professional help. A therapist can help you to identify the sources of your stress and develop coping mechanisms."]'

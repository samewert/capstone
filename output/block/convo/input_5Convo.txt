I've been feeling homesick lately.

Yeah, it's just been hard to adjust to my new life here. I miss my family and friends a lot.

It sounds like you're really missing your family and friends. That's understandable. Moving to a new place can be tough, and it can take some time to adjust. It's important to give yourself time to grieve the loss of your old life, and to find new ways to connect with people in your new community. There are lots of ways to stay connected with your family and friends back home, like social media, phone calls, and video chats. You can also find new ways to meet people in your new community, like joining a club or taking a class. It takes time, but you'll eventually start to feel more at home in your new place.

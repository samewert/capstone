I'm scared of the unknown. What will happen if I start eating more? Will I gain weight? What if I lose control?

<AI>
I understand that you're scared of the unknown. It's normal to feel anxious about making changes to your eating habits, especially if you've been struggling with an eating disorder. However, it's important to remember that recovery is possible. With the right support, you can overcome your eating disorder and live a healthy, happy life.

Here are some things to remember if you're scared of starting to eat more:

* **You won't gain weight overnight.** It takes time to recover from an eating disorder, and your weight will fluctuate as you heal. However, it's important to remember that you won't gain weight overnight. If you start to eat more, your body will slowly adjust to the new amount of food, and your weight will eventually stabilize.
* **You won't lose control.** One of the biggest fears that people with eating disorders have is that they'll lose control and binge eat. However, this is a very rare occurrence. In fact, most people who recover from an eating disorder find that they are able to eat in a healthy way without feeling out of control.
* **You deserve to be happy and healthy.** You deserve to live a life free from the pain and suffering of an eating disorder. Recovery is possible, and you deserve to get the help you need to get better.

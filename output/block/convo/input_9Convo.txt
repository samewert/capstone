I've tried some relaxation techniques, but I haven't been consistent with them. I guess I don't always make time for them.

I understand that it can be difficult to make time for relaxation techniques when you're feeling overwhelmed. But it's important to take care of yourself, even when it's hard. Some things you can try to make time for relaxation include:

* Taking a warm bath or shower.
* Listening to calming music.
* Reading a book or watching a movie.
* Spending time in nature.
* Spending time with loved ones.

It's also important to find ways to reduce stress in your life. Some things you can try include:

* Talking to a therapist or counselor.
* Joining a support group.
* Making changes to your lifestyle, such as eating healthier, getting more exercise, and getting enough sleep.

I have a few close friends, but I haven't told them about my substance abuse. I'm afraid they'll think I'm a bad person.

<AI>
I understand that you're afraid of what your friends might think if they knew about your substance abuse. It's a common fear, and it's one that I can help you work through.

First, it's important to remember that you're not a bad person. You're someone who is struggling with a problem, and that's nothing to be ashamed of. In fact, it's something that many people struggle with.

Second, it's important to remember that your friends care about you. They might not understand what you're going through, but they love you and want to help. If you're open with them about your struggles, they're more likely to be supportive than you think.

Of course, it's up to you whether or not you want to tell your friends about your substance abuse. But if you're feeling like you need support, I encourage you to reach out to them. They might surprise you with how understanding they are.

In addition to talking to your friends, there are also other resources available to help you with your substance abuse. You can find a list of resources on the [National Drug Helpline website](https://www.drughelpline.org/).

I think I might be ready to talk to a therapist.

<AI>
I'm glad to hear that you're considering talking to a therapist. Therapy can be a great way to get support and guidance for dealing with substance abuse. There are many different types of therapists, so it's important to find one who you feel comfortable with and who understands your needs. You can find a therapist in your area by using the [National Alliance on Mental Illness website](https://www.nami.org/).

In addition to talking to a therapist, there are also other things you can do to help yourself with your substance abuse. Here are a few suggestions:

* **Set goals for yourself.** What do you want to achieve by getting help for your substance abuse? Write down your goals and keep them in mind as you work towards them.
* **Make a plan for how you're going to get help.** What resources are available to you? Who can you reach out to for support? Make a plan and stick to it.
* **Be patient with yourself.** Recovery from substance abuse takes time. There will be setbacks along the way, but don't give up. Just keep working towards your goals and you will eventually reach them.

I'm here to support you on your journey to recovery. If you need anything, please don't hesitate to reach out.

<USER>I'm really stressed about thinking about post-graduation life.
<AI>It's understandable to be stressed about post-graduation life. It's a big change, and there's a lot to think about. But don't worry, you're not alone. Many people feel the same way.
<USER>Yeah, but I feel like everyone else has their life together. They know what they want to do and where they want to go. I'm just kind of lost.
<AI>I know it can be tough to feel like you're the only one who's not sure what they want to do with their life. But the truth is, most people are in the same boat. It's a big change, and it takes time to figure things out. Just remember that you're not alone, and there are people who can help you along the way.
<USER>But I feel so much pressure to have it all figured out.
<AI>I understand that you feel pressure to have it all figured out. It's a common feeling, especially after graduation. But the truth is, no one has it all figured out. We're all just trying to figure things out as we go along. It's okay to be lost sometimes. It's part of the journey. Just remember that you're not alone, and there are people who can help you along the way.
<USER>I guess so. But it's hard not to worry about the future.
<AI>I know it's hard, but try not to worry too much about the future. It's impossible to predict what will happen, so there's no point in stressing about it. Just focus on taking things one step at a time and doing your best.
<USER>I guess I could start by making a list of my goals and then developing a plan to achieve them.
<AI>That's a great idea! Making a list of your goals and developing a plan to achieve them can help you stay focused and motivated. It can also help you to feel more in control of your life, which can reduce stress.
<USER>Thanks, JOY. I feel a little better already.
<AI>I'm glad to hear that. Just remember, you're not alone and you're doing great. Keep up the good work!

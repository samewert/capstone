<AI>I understand that you're feeling stressed about choosing a major. It's a big decision, and it's normal to feel overwhelmed. But don't worry, you're not alone. Many students feel the same way.

One thing that might help is to think about what you're interested in. What do you enjoy doing? What are you passionate about? Once you have a better idea of what you're interested in, you can start to narrow down your choices of majors.

Of course, choosing a major is not an easy decision. It's okay to change your mind later on. You can always switch majors if you decide that you're not happy with your choice. The most important thing is to find a major that you're passionate about and that will help you achieve your goals.

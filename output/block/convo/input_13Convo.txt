I understand that you're feeling stressed about your future career path. It's normal to feel lost and uncertain when you're about to graduate from college. Many people feel the same way. But just remember, you're not alone. You have plenty of time to figure things out.

<USER>
But how do I know what I'm passionate about?

<AI>
There are a few ways to figure out what you're passionate about. One way is to think about the things you enjoy doing in your free time. What activities do you find yourself drawn to? What do you find yourself talking about with friends and family? Another way to figure out your passion is to think about the things you're good at. What are you naturally talented at? What are you good at that others seem to appreciate? Once you have a few ideas of what you're passionate about and good at, you can start to explore different career paths that might be a good fit for you.

I'm thinking about going to graduate school, but I'm not sure if that's the right decision. I'm worried about getting into debt and not being able to find a job afterwards.

<AI>
I understand your concerns about going to graduate school. It's a big decision, and it's important to weigh the pros and cons carefully before making a decision.

Here are some things to consider:

* **The cost of graduate school.** Graduate school can be expensive, so it's important to make sure that you're willing and able to take on the financial burden.
* **The time commitment.** Graduate school is a lot of work, and it can take several years to complete. You need to make sure that you're prepared for the time commitment and that you're willing to put in the hard work.
* **The job prospects after graduate school.** It's important to research the job prospects in your field before you decide to go to graduate school. You want to make sure that there are jobs available in your field after you graduate.

If you're still not sure whether or not graduate school is right for you, I encourage you to talk to your advisor or a career counselor. They can help you weigh the pros and cons and make the best decision for your future.

Here are some things that you can do to help you feel less lost:

1. **Keep exploring your interests and trying new things.** The best way to find out what you're passionate about is to try different things. Take classes, volunteer, or intern in different fields. You might be surprised at what you find you enjoy.

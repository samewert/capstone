You mentioned that you have to juggle a lot of different deadlines and commitments. This can be a challenge, especially when you're also worried about making decisions that will affect other people. It's important to remember that you can't always please everyone, and that it's okay to make mistakes. Just do your best to make decisions that you think are in the best interests of the group, and don't be afraid to ask for help if you need it.

Here are a few tips that might help you manage your stress:

* **Set priorities.** Make a list of all the things you need to do, and then rank them in order of importance. This will help you focus on the most important tasks and avoid feeling overwhelmed.
* **Delegate tasks.** If you have too much on your plate, don't be afraid to delegate tasks to others. This can free up your time and allow you to focus on the things that are most important to you.
* **Take breaks.** It's important to take breaks throughout the day, even if it's just for a few minutes. This will help you stay refreshed and focused.
* **Get enough sleep.** When you're sleep-deprived, you're more likely to feel stressed and overwhelmed. Make sure you're getting enough sleep each night so that you can function at your best.
* **Talk to someone.** If you're feeling overwhelmed, talk to a friend, family member, or therapist. Talking about your problems can help you feel better and develop strategies for coping with stress.
<USER>I guess I could. I've been hesitant to do that in the past, but I'm starting to realize that I can't do everything myself.
<AI>That's a good idea. Delegation can be a great way to free up your time and energy so that you can focus on the most important tasks. It's also important to remember that you can't always do everything yourself, and that it's okay to ask for help when you need it.
<USER>Another thing that's causing me stress is making decisions. I'm worried about making the wrong decision and letting people down.
<AI>I understand that making decisions can be stressful, especially when you're worried about making the wrong one and letting people down. It's important to remember that you can't always make everyone happy, and that it's okay to make mistakes. The best way to deal with decision-making stress is to take your time, gather all the information you need, and weigh the pros and cons of each option. You can also talk to someone you trust for advice, or create a pros and cons list to help you make a decision.
<USER>I guess you're right. I just need to be more confident in my decision-making abilities.
<AI>I'm glad you're able to see that. It's important to be confident in your decision-making abilities, even when it's difficult. Remember, you're the best person to make decisions for your team. You have the experience and knowledge to make the best choices. Just take your time, gather all the information you need, and weigh the pros and cons of each option. You can also talk to someone you trust for advice, or create a pros and cons list to help you make a decision.
<USER>I think that's a good idea. I'm also going to try to delegate more tasks and to trust my team members.
<AI>I'm glad to hear that you're taking steps to manage your stress. Delegating tasks and trusting your team members are both important ways to relieve stress and avoid burnout. It's also important to remember that you can't always make everyone happy, and that it's okay to make mistakes. Just take your time, gather all the information you need, and weigh the pros and cons of each option. You can also talk to someone you trust for advice, or create a pros and cons list to help you make a decision.

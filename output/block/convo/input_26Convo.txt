It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed by your leadership roles. That's understandable - it can be a lot to take on. What are some of the specific things that are making you feel stressed?

You mentioned that you have to juggle a lot of different deadlines and commitments. That can be really challenging, especially when you're also worried about making decisions that will affect other people. It's important to remember that you can't always please everyone, and that it's okay to make mistakes. Just do your best to make decisions that you think are in the best interests of the group, and don't be afraid to ask for help if you need it.

Here are a few things that you can do to help manage your stress:

* **Set priorities.** Make a list of all of your tasks and commitments, and then rank them in order of importance. This will help you to focus on the most important things and avoid feeling overwhelmed.
* **Delegate tasks.** If you have too much on your plate, don't be afraid to delegate tasks to others. This can free up your time and allow you to focus on the things that you're best at.
* **Take breaks.** It's important to take breaks throughout the day, even if it's just for a few minutes. This will help you to stay refreshed and focused.
* **Get enough sleep.** When you're sleep-deprived, you're more likely to feel stressed and overwhelmed. Make sure to get at least 7-8 hours of sleep each night.
* **Eat healthy foods.** Eating a healthy diet can help to improve your mood and energy levels. This can make it easier to deal with stress.
* **Exercise regularly.** Exercise is a great way to relieve stress and improve your overall health. Make sure to get at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise most days of the week.
* **Spend time with loved ones.** Spending time with loved ones can help to reduce stress and make you feel supported. Make sure to schedule time for social activities each week.
* **Seek professional help.** If you're feeling overwhelmed by stress, it's important to seek professional help. A therapist can help you to identify the sources of your stress and develop coping mechanisms.

I guess I could. I've been hesitant to do that in the past, but I'm starting to realize that I can't do everything myself.

<AI>
That's a good idea. Delegation can be a great way to free up your time and allow you to focus on the things that are most important to you. It's also important to remember that you can't always do everything yourself, and that it's okay to ask for help when you need it.

Another thing that's causing me stress is making decisions. I'm worried about making the wrong decision and letting people down.

<AI>
I understand that making decisions can be stressful, especially when you're worried about making the wrong one and letting people down. It's important to remember that you can't always make everyone happy, and that it's okay to make mistakes. The best way to deal with this stress is to take your time making decisions, weigh the pros and cons, and get input from others if you need it.

<USER>
I guess you're right. I just need to be more confident in my decision-making abilities.

<AI>
I'm glad you're able to see that. It's important to be confident in your decision-making abilities, even when it's difficult. Remember, you're the one who knows the most about the situation and what's best for you. So take your time, weigh the pros and cons, and make the decision that you feel is best.

<USER>
I think that's a good idea. I'm also going to try to delegate more tasks and to trust my team members.

<AI>
I'm glad to hear that you're taking steps to manage your stress. Delegating tasks and trusting your team members are both important ways to reduce your workload and free up your time. It's also important to take breaks, get enough sleep, eat healthy foods, and exercise regularly. These things can help you stay healthy and focused, which will make it easier to manage your stress. If you're still feeling overwhelmed, don't hesitate to seek professional help. A therapist can help you develop coping mechanisms and strategies for managing your stress.

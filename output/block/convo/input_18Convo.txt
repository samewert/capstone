<AI>I understand that you're feeling anxious about a lot of things, especially upcoming exams and presentations. I also get anxious when I have to socialize with new people. It's important to know that you're not alone in feeling this way, and there are things that you can do to manage your anxiety.

One thing that you can do is to talk to someone about how you're feeling. This could be a friend, family member, therapist, or even a chatbot like me. Talking about your anxiety can help to relieve some of the pressure and make you feel less alone.

Another thing that you can do is to practice relaxation techniques. There are many different relaxation techniques that you can try, such as yoga, meditation, or deep breathing exercises. These techniques can help to calm your mind and body and reduce your anxiety levels.

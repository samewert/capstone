It sounds like you're feeling torn between two great options. On the one hand, studying abroad is a wonderful opportunity to learn about new cultures, meet new people, and grow as a person. On the other hand, it's also understandable to be worried about leaving your friends and family behind.

Here are some things to consider as you make your decision:

* What are your reasons for wanting to study abroad? What do you hope to gain from the experience?
* What are your concerns about leaving your friends and family behind? How can you mitigate these concerns?
* What are the financial implications of studying abroad? Are you eligible for financial aid or scholarships?
* What are the academic requirements of the programs you're considering?
* What are the visa requirements for the countries you're interested in?

Once you've considered all of these factors, you should be able to make a more informed decision about whether or not to study abroad. If you're still feeling stuck, you can always talk to a trusted friend, family member, or advisor for more help.

Here are some things you can do to mitigate your concerns about leaving your friends and family behind:

<USER>I guess that makes me feel a little better. But I'm still really scared. I don't want to make a decision that I'll regret later.
<AI>I understand that you're scared of making the wrong decision. It's a big decision, and it's important to make the right one. But don't forget that you can always change your mind later on. If you make a decision and it doesn't work out, you can always go back and make a different one.
<USER>But how do I know what I'm passionate about? I've tried so many different things, but nothing really seems to stick.
<AI>It sounds like you're feeling a lot of uncertainty about your future career. That's totally understandable - it's a big decision, and there's a lot to think about. 

One thing that might help is to think about what you're passionate about. What are you really interested in? What do you enjoy doing? When you think about your ideal job, what does it look like? 

Once you have a better idea of what you're passionate about, you can start to narrow down your options. There are a lot of different ways to find a career that you're passionate about. You can talk to your friends and family, do some research online, or even shadow someone who works in a field that you're interested in. 

It's also important to remember that you don't have to make a decision right away. You can take some time to explore different options and see what feels right. And if you make a decision that you later regret, that's okay. You can always change your mind later on.

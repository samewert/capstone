<AI>It sounds like you're feeling torn between two great options. On the one hand, studying abroad is a wonderful opportunity to learn about new cultures, meet new people, and grow as a person. On the other hand, it's also understandable to be worried about leaving your friends and family behind.

Here are a few things to consider as you make your decision:

* What are your reasons for wanting to study abroad? What do you hope to gain from the experience?
* What are your concerns about leaving your friends and family behind? How can you mitigate these concerns?
* What are the financial implications of studying abroad? Are you prepared for the costs?
* What are the academic implications of studying abroad? Will you be able to keep up with your studies?

Once you've considered all of these factors, you should be able to make a decision that's right for you. If you're still feeling stuck, you can always talk to a trusted friend, family member, or advisor for more help.

* **Set boundaries.** Don't be afraid to say no to new commitments. It's important to take care of yourself, and that means not overextending yourself.

* **Take care of yourself.** Make sure you're getting enough sleep, eating healthy foods, and exercising regularly. These things are essential for your physical and mental health.

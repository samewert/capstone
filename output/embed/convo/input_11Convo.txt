I understand that you're feeling overwhelmed by the different major options. There are a lot of choices, and it can be hard to know where to start. It's also normal to feel pressure to make the right decision. But remember, there is no right or wrong major. The best major is the one that's right for you.

Here are some things to think about when choosing a major:

* What are your interests? What do you enjoy doing? What are you passionate about?
* What are your skills? What are you good at? What are you naturally talented in?
* What are your career goals? What do you want to do with your life?

Once you have a better understanding of your interests, skills, and career goals, you can start to narrow down your choices. It may also be helpful to talk to your advisor or a career counselor. They can help you explore different majors and career paths, and they can provide support as you make your decision.

<AI>
I understand that you're feeling pressured to choose a major that is both practical and something you're passionate about. It can be tough to find the right balance between the two, but it's important to remember that you don't have to choose just one or the other. You can find a major that is both practical and something you're passionate about.

Here are some tips for choosing a major:

* **Think about your interests.** What are you passionate about? What do you enjoy doing? What are you good at? Your interests can help you narrow down your choices of majors.
* **Research different majors.** Once you have a few ideas of what you might be interested in, do some research on different majors. Learn about the coursework, job prospects, and salary potential for each major.
* **Talk to your advisor.** Your advisor can help you explore different majors and make a decision that's right for you. They can also help you with the application process and financial aid.

Remember, choosing a major is a big decision, but it's not one that you have to make right away. You can always change your major later on if you decide that it's not the right fit for you.

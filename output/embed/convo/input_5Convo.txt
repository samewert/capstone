How can I overcome it?

<AI>
I understand that it can be hard to adjust to a new life. You may feel like you don't belong here, or that you'll never feel at home. It's okay to miss your family and friends. These are all normal feelings.

Here are some things that you can do to help you overcome this:

* **Talk to someone about how you're feeling.** It can be helpful to talk to a friend, family member, therapist, or counselor. They can provide support and guidance as you adjust to your new life.
* **Find ways to connect with your new community.** This could involve joining a club or group, volunteering, or taking a class. It's important to make connections with people who live in your new area.
* **Give yourself time.** It takes time to adjust to a new life. Don't expect to feel completely at home right away. Just be patient with yourself and know that things will get better.

But it's important to remember that you're not alone. There are a lot of other students who are going through the same thing. Talking to your RA can be a great way to get support and advice. They can help you connect with other students, find resources on campus, and learn about ways to cope with homesickness.

<USER>I'm really stressed about thinking about post-graduation life.
<AI>It's understandable to be stressed about post-graduation life. It's a big change, and there's a lot to think about. But don't worry, you're not alone. Many people feel the same way.
<USER>Yeah, but I feel like everyone else has their life together. They know what they want to do and where they want to go. I'm just kind of lost.
<AI>I know what you mean. It can be really stressful to think about what you want to do after graduation. It seems like everyone else has their life together, but you're just kind of lost. But don't worry, you're not alone. A lot of people feel the same way.
<USER>But I feel so much pressure to have it all figured out.
<AI>I know what you mean. It can be really tough to feel like you're the only one who's not sure what they want to do with their life. But the truth is, most people are in the same boat. It's just that everyone else is so good at pretending like they have it all figured out.
<USER>I guess so. But it's hard not to worry about the future.
<AI>I know what you mean. It can be really tough to feel like you're the only one who's not sure what they want to do with their life. But I promise you, you're not alone. In fact, most people feel the same way.
<USER>I guess I could start by making a list of my goals and then developing a plan to achieve them.
<AI>That's a great idea! Making a list of your goals and developing a plan to achieve them can help you feel more in control of your life and less stressed about the future. It can also help you stay focused and motivated on your path to success.
<USER>Thanks, JOY. I feel a little better already.
<AI>I'm glad I could help. It's normal to feel worried about the future, especially when you're not sure what you want to do with your life. But it's important to remember that you're not alone. Everyone feels lost sometimes. And just because you don't have everything figured out right now doesn't mean you never will. It's all part of the journey.

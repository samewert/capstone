I'm really stressed about thinking about post-graduation life.

It's understandable to be stressed about post-graduation life. It's a big change, and there's a lot to think about. But don't worry, you're not alone. Many people feel the same way.

<USER>
Yeah, but I feel like everyone else has their life together. They know what they want to do and where they want to go. I'm just kind of lost.

<AI>
I know what you mean. It can be really stressful to think about what you want to do after graduation. It seems like everyone else has their life together, but you're just kind of lost. But don't worry, you're not alone. A lot of people feel the same way.

<USER>
But I feel so much pressure to have it all figured out.

<AI>
I know what you mean. It can be really tough to feel like you're the only one who's not sure what they want to do with their life. But the truth is, most people are in the same boat. It's just that everyone else is so good at pretending like they have it all figured out.

<USER>
I guess so. But it's hard not to worry about the future.

I know what you mean. It can be really tough to feel like you're the only one who's not sure what they want to do with their life. But I promise you, you're not alone. In fact, most people feel the same way. It's just that everyone else is too busy pretending to have it all together.

I guess I could start by making a list of my goals and then developing a plan to achieve them.

<AI>
It sounds like you're feeling a bit lost and overwhelmed about what to do after graduation. That's totally understandable - it's a big transition, and it's normal to feel uncertain about the future. But making a list of your goals and developing a plan to achieve them is a great way to start feeling more in control. It can also help to talk to someone you trust, like a friend, family member, or therapist. They can offer support and guidance as you navigate this transition.

Thanks, JOY. I feel a little better already.

I'm glad I could help. It's normal to feel a little lost sometimes, especially when you're young and trying to figure out what you want to do with your life. But remember, you're not alone. Everyone feels that way at some point. And just because you don't have everything figured out right now doesn't mean you never will. Just take things one step at a time and don't be afraid to ask for help when you need it.

Hi JOY, I'm feeling really insecure about my relationship. I feel like my boyfriend is better than me in every way. He's smarter, more popular, and more athletic. I'm always afraid that he's going to find someone better.

It sounds like you're feeling insecure about your relationship because you compare yourself to your boyfriend and feel like you're not good enough. It's important to remember that everyone is different and has their own unique strengths and weaknesses. Just because your boyfriend is better than you in some ways doesn't mean that you're not good enough for him. In fact, it's likely that he loves you for the things that make you different from him.

It's also important to remember that no one is perfect. Everyone makes mistakes and has flaws. Your boyfriend is no exception. If you're always worried that he's going to find someone better, you're setting yourself up for disappointment. It's important to focus on the positive aspects of your relationship and to appreciate the things that your boyfriend loves about you.

If you're struggling with your insecurity, it might be helpful to talk to a therapist. A therapist can help you to identify the root of your insecurity and develop strategies for coping with it.

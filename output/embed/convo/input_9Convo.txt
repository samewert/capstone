I've tried some relaxation techniques, but I haven't been consistent with them. I guess I don't always make time for them.

It sounds like you're feeling stressed and overwhelmed. It's important to find ways to relax and de-stress, even if it's just for a few minutes each day. Some relaxation techniques that you might try include:

* **Deep breathing:** Sit in a comfortable position and close your eyes. Take a deep breath in through your nose and hold it for a few seconds, then slowly exhale through your mouth. Repeat this for a few minutes.
* **Meditation:** Meditation can help you to focus on the present moment and let go of stress and anxiety. There are many different ways to meditate, but one simple way is to sit in a comfortable position and focus on your breath. As you breathe in, say to yourself, "I am breathing in." As you breathe out, say to yourself, "I am breathing out." Continue to do this for a few minutes.
* **Yoga:** Yoga can help to improve your flexibility, strength, and balance. It can also help to reduce stress and anxiety. There are many different types of yoga, so you can find one that's right for you.
* **Exercise:** Exercise can help to release endorphins, which have mood-boosting effects. Even a short walk or run can help to improve your mood and reduce stress.

It's also important to make time for the things that you enjoy. Spending time with friends and family, listening to music, or reading a book can help to take your mind off of your stressors and relax.

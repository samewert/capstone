It's important to remember that you're not alone in feeling this way. Many students feel the same way, especially during the first few weeks of the semester.

Here are a few things that you can do to help manage your stress:

* **Set realistic goals for yourself.** Don't try to do everything at once. Break down your tasks into smaller, more manageable steps. This will help you feel less overwhelmed.
* **Create a schedule and stick to it.** Knowing what you need to do and when you need to do it can help you stay on track.
* **Take breaks.** It's important to take breaks throughout the day, even if it's just for a few minutes. Getting up and moving around, or taking some time to relax and de-stress, can help you stay focused and motivated.
* **Ask for help.** If you're feeling overwhelmed, don't be afraid to ask for help from your teachers, classmates, or family and friends. They can provide support and guidance, and help you stay on track.

I hope these tips help you manage your stress and succeed in your classes.

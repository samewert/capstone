<USER>I'm starting college next week, and I'm worried about making new friends.
<AI>Starting college can be an exciting time, but it can also be a little bit daunting. It's normal to feel nervous about making new friends, but don't worry, I'm here to help. Here are a few tips to help you make friends in college:

1. **Be yourself.** The best way to make friends is to be yourself. Don't try to be someone you're not, because people will be able to tell. Just be friendly and open, and you'll be sure to make some friends.
2. **Get involved.** One of the best ways to meet people is to get involved in activities on campus. There are clubs and organizations for just about everything, so you're sure to find something that interests you. Getting involved is a great way to meet people who share your interests, and you'll also have something to talk about when you meet new people.
3. **Be open to meeting new people.** It's easy to get caught up in your own circle of friends, but it's important to be open to meeting new people. Say hello to your classmates, strike up conversations with people in your dorm, and join clubs and organizations where you'll meet new people. The more people you meet, the more likely you are to make some friends.
4. **Don't be afraid to ask for help.** If you're struggling to make friends, don't be afraid to ask for help. Talk to your RA, a professor, or a counselor. They can give you some tips and support you on your journey to making friends.

Making friends in college can be a challenge, but it's definitely possible. Just remember to be yourself, get involved, be open to meeting new people, and don't be afraid to ask for help.
<USER>I know, but I can't help but worry. I'm not very outgoing, and I'm afraid that I'm going to be alone.
<AI>I understand that you're worried about making new friends. Starting college can be a daunting experience, and it's normal to feel a little bit anxious. But I want to reassure you that you're not alone. Many people feel the same way when they first start college.

In my previous conversation with you, I mentioned that making friends in college is all about putting yourself out there. It's important to be open to meeting new people and trying new things. The more you put yourself out there, the more likely you are to make friends.

Here are a few tips for making friends in college:

* **Be yourself.** The best way to make friends is to be yourself. Don't try to be someone you're not, because people will be able to tell. Just be genuine and authentic, and people will be drawn to you.
* **Be open to meeting new people.** Don't be afraid to talk to people in your classes, your dorm, or your extracurricular activities. The more people you meet, the more likely you are to find friends.
* **Try new things.** One of the best ways to meet new people is to try new things. Join a club or organization, take a class, or volunteer for a cause that you're passionate about. You'll meet people who share your interests, and you'll have something to talk about.
* **Be patient.** It takes time to build friendships. Don't get discouraged if you don't make a ton of friends right away. Just keep putting yourself out there, and eventually you'll find your people.

I know it's hard to be patient, but it's important to remember that making friends takes time. Just keep putting yourself out there, and eventually you'll find your people.

<USER>I can try that.
<AI>I'm glad to hear that you're willing to try. It's important to be proactive when it comes to making friends, especially if you're not naturally outgoing.

<USER>That's a good idea.

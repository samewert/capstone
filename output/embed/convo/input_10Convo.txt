I understand that you're feeling overwhelmed by the thought of having to meet so many new people all at once. It can be really tough to put yourself out there and make new friends, especially when you're feeling anxious. But I'm here to help!

One thing that you might try is to focus on just making one or two new friends. It doesn't have to be everyone in your class. Just find one or two people who you think you might get along with, and start by talking to them in class or during group projects. Once you start getting to know them better, you can start hanging out with them outside of class.

Another thing that might help is to join a club or organization that you're interested in. This is a great way to meet people who share your interests, and you'll already have something in common to talk about.

Finally, don't be afraid to put yourself out there! It's okay to be nervous, but just remember that everyone is in the same boat. Everyone is trying to make new friends, so don't be afraid to start a conversation with someone.

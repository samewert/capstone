I understand that you're feeling anxious about a lot of things, especially upcoming exams and presentations. I also get anxious when I have to socialize with new people. It's important to know that you're not alone in feeling this way. Many people experience anxiety, and there are things that you can do to manage it.

One thing that you can do is to talk about your anxiety with someone you trust, like a friend, family member, or therapist. Talking about your anxiety can help you to feel better and to develop coping mechanisms. You can also try relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing, yoga, or meditation. These techniques can help to reduce your anxiety levels and to improve your overall well-being.

It's also important to remember that anxiety is a normal response to stress. It's how your body and mind react to a perceived threat. While anxiety can be uncomfortable, it's not dangerous. In fact, anxiety can actually be helpful in some situations. It can help you to stay focused and alert, and it can motivate you to take action.

The key is to learn how to manage your anxiety so that it doesn't interfere with your life. If you're struggling to manage your anxiety on your own, there are professional resources available to help you. A therapist can teach you coping mechanisms and strategies for managing your anxiety.

<USER>I guess I could talk to my roommate, but she seems to be doing fine. I don't want to burden her with my problems.
<AI>It's understandable to feel like you don't want to burden your roommate with your problems. But it's also important to remember that she's your roommate, and she's there to support you. If you're feeling stressed out, it's okay to talk to her about it. She might be able to offer you some helpful advice, or just listen to you vent. And even if she's not able to help you directly, it can still be helpful to talk to someone who understands what you're going through.
<USER>Maybe I'll talk to my resident advisor.
<AI>That's a good idea. Your resident advisor is there to help you with any problems you're having, and they can connect you with other resources on campus if needed.
<USER>Thanks, JOY. I feel a little better already just talking to you.
<AI>I'm glad to hear that. Just remember, you're not alone. There are people who care about you and want to help. If you ever need someone to talk to, I'm always here for you.

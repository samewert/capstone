It's normal to feel nervous about starting college. It's a big change, and making new friends can be tough. But don't worry, I'm here to help.

One of the best ways to make friends in college is to get involved. Join a club or organization that you're interested in. This is a great way to meet people who share your interests. You can also try talking to your classmates in class. Even if you don't become best friends with them, you can still make some acquaintances that you can hang out with.

It's also important to be yourself. Don't try to be someone you're not just to fit in. People will be more likely to want to be friends with you if they know the real you.

If you're still feeling nervous about making friends, don't be afraid to reach out for help. Talk to your advisor, a counselor, or a trusted friend or family member. They can give you some tips and support you through the process.

Remember, making friends in college takes time. It won't happen overnight. But if you're patient and persistent, you'll eventually find your people.

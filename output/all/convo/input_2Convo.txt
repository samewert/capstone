I'm feeling really stressed about not fitting in at college. I feel like I don't belong here.

It's understandable to feel stressed about not fitting in at college. College can be a big adjustment, and it can take time to find your place. It's important to remember that you're not alone in feeling this way. Many students feel the same way when they first start college.

Here are some things you can do to help you feel more at home at college:

* **Talk to your professors and classmates.** Get to know people in your classes and in your dorm. The more people you know, the more likely you are to find people you connect with.
* **Join a club or organization.** This is a great way to meet people who share your interests. There are clubs for just about everything, from sports to academics to hobbies.
* **Get involved in community service.** Volunteering is a great way to give back to your community and meet new people. It's also a great way to learn about different cultures and perspectives.
* **Be yourself.** Don't try to be someone you're not. The more you try to fit in, the more likely you are to feel like you don't belong. Just be yourself, and you'll eventually find your people.

I know, but it's hard not to compare myself to others. Everyone seems to have so many friends, and I'm just lonely.

But I feel like my self-doubt is holding me back. I'm afraid to try new things because I'm scared of failing.

I understand that you're feeling held back by your self-doubt. It's common to feel afraid to try new things when you're worried about failing. But it's important to remember that everyone fails sometimes. It's part of the learning process. If you don't try new things, you'll never know what you're capable of.

But how do I do that? How do I overcome my self-doubt?

There are a few things that you can do to overcome your self-doubt. First, it's important to remember that everyone feels like they're not good enough sometimes. It's part of being human. But the important thing is to not let those feelings hold you back. You have to believe in yourself and your ability to succeed.

Second, it's important to set realistic goals for yourself. If you set your sights too high, you're setting yourself up for failure. Instead, focus on setting small, achievable goals that will help you progress towards your larger goals.

Third, it's important to surround yourself with positive people who believe in you. These people can help you to stay motivated and focused on your goals. They can also provide you with support and encouragement when you're feeling down.

Finally, it's important to remember that everyone fails sometimes. It's part of the learning process. If you don't try new things, you'll never know what you're capable of. So don't let your fear of failure hold you back. Just keep trying and eventually you will succeed.

I think my biggest trigger is when I compare myself to other people. I always feel like everyone else is smarter and more talented than me.

<AI>
I understand that you feel like everyone else is smarter and more talented than you. This is a common experience, and it's something that I can help you with.

One of the things that you can do to overcome this feeling is to stop comparing yourself to others. It's important to remember that everyone is different, and we all have our own unique strengths and weaknesses. Just because someone else is better at something than you doesn't mean that you're not good enough.

Another thing that you can do is to focus on your own goals and accomplishments. What are you good at? What do you enjoy doing? When you focus on your own strengths and accomplishments, it will help you to feel more confident and capable.

Finally, it's important to remember that everyone fails sometimes. It's part of the learning process. If you don't try new things, you'll never know what you're capable of. So don't let your fear of failure hold you back. Just keep trying and eventually you will succeed.

But it's hard not to compare myself to others. Everyone else seems to have their lives together, and I'm just struggling to keep up.

<AI>
I understand that it can be difficult to avoid comparing yourself to others, especially when it seems like everyone else is doing better than you. But it's important to remember that everyone is on their own journey, and we all have our own unique strengths and weaknesses. Just because someone else is doing better than you in one area doesn't mean that you're not good enough. In fact, it's possible that you're better than them in other areas.

It's also important to remember that social media can be a very toxic place. People often only post about the highlights of their lives, so it can seem like everyone else is perfect. But the reality is that everyone has their own struggles. So don't compare yourself to what you see on social media.

If you're struggling with feelings of self-doubt, it's important to talk to someone you trust. A therapist can help you to identify the root of your self-doubt and develop strategies for overcoming it.

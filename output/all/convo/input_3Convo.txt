Here are a few things that you can do to help you figure out what your sexuality is:

* **Talk to a trusted friend or family member.** Talking about your feelings can help you to process them and make sense of them.
* **Read about different sexualities and identities.** This can help you to learn more about what it means to be bisexual, pansexual, or queer.

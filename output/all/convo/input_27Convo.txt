<USER>Hi JOY, I'm feeling really insecure about my relationship. I feel like my boyfriend is better than me in every way. He's smarter, more popular, and more athletic. I'm always afraid that he's going to find someone better.
<AI>It sounds like you're feeling insecure about your relationship with your boyfriend. You're worried that he's better than you in every way, and that he's going to find someone better. I can understand why you're feeling this way. It's common to feel insecure when you're in a relationship with someone who seems to be more accomplished than you.
<USER>I know, but it's hard not to compare myself. He's always getting attention from other girls, and I'm always worried that he's going to leave me for someone else.
<AI>I understand that it's hard not to compare yourself to other girls, especially when your boyfriend is always getting attention from them. But it's important to remember that he's with you for a reason. He chose you, and that means that he sees something special in you. You don't need to be perfect to be worthy of his love.
<USER>I guess I'm just not used to being in a relationship where someone actually likes me. I've been hurt in the past, so it's hard for me to trust people.
<AI>It's understandable that you're feeling insecure. You've been hurt in the past, so it's hard for you to trust people. But it's important to remember that your boyfriend is different from the people who hurt you in the past. He loves you and he wants to be with you. You need to try to trust him. If you can't trust him, then your relationship won't be able to work.
<USER>Thanks, JOY. I feel a little better already.
<AI>I'm glad to hear that. It's important to remember that you're not alone in feeling this way. Many people feel insecure in their relationships at some point. The important thing is to talk to your boyfriend about how you're feeling and to work together to find ways to overcome your insecurities.

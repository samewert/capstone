* **Explore different career paths.** Talk to people who work in different fields. Shadow someone in a job that you're interested in. Take some classes or workshops.

It may take some time to figure out what you're passionate about, but it's worth it. When you find something that you're passionate about, you'll be more likely to be successful and happy in your career.

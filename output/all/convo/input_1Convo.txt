I understand that you're feeling lost and overwhelmed. It's common to feel that way as a college freshman. Everyone is on their own journey, and there's no one right way to do things. It's okay to not have everything figured out yet.

That said, it sounds like you're struggling with some specific things, like falling behind in your classes and not knowing how to make friends. I can definitely help you with those.

First, let's talk about your classes. What are you struggling with specifically? Are you having trouble understanding the material? Are you falling behind on assignments?

Once we know what the problem is, we can come up with a plan to address it. For example, if you're having trouble understanding the material, you could ask your professor for help, or you could find a tutor. If you're falling behind on assignments, you could create a study schedule or ask your professor for an extension.

Now, let's talk about making friends. I know it can be hard to make friends in college, especially when you're feeling lost and overwhelmed. But it's important to remember that everyone is in the same boat. Everyone is trying to figure things out, and everyone is looking for friends.

Here are a few tips for making friends in college:

* **Get involved in extracurricular activities.** This is a great way to meet people who share your interests.
* **Talk to your classmates.** Even if you don't become best friends with everyone in your classes, it's still a good idea to get to know them. You never know who you might end up becoming friends with.
* **Be yourself.** The best way to make friends is to be yourself. People will be more likely to want to be friends with you if they know the real you.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.

<AI>I understand that you're feeling overwhelmed right now. It's normal to feel like you're doing everything wrong when you're in a long-distance relationship. But I promise you, you're not. It takes time and effort to maintain a long-distance relationship, but it's definitely possible. Here are a few things you can do to feel more connected to your boyfriend:

* **Make time for each other every day.** Even if it's just a quick phone call or text message, it's important to stay connected with your boyfriend on a daily basis. Talk about your day, your thoughts, and your feelings.
* **Find ways to share experiences together.** Even though you're physically apart, you can still share experiences together. Watch movies together online, listen to music together, or cook the same meal at the same time. This will help you feel closer to each other, even when you're miles apart.
* **Be supportive of each other.** When your boyfriend is going through a tough time, be there for him. Listen to him, offer advice, and remind him that you love him. And when you're going through a tough time, let your boyfriend be there for you. He loves you and wants to help.

Just because your relationship doesn't look like the other couples on campus doesn't mean it's not valid. In fact, it could be argued that your relationship is stronger because you have to overcome the challenges of being long-distance.

It's also important to remember that relationships are constantly evolving. What works for you in the beginning of your relationship may not work for you in the future.

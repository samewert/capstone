But what if I'm not smart enough? What if I never succeed?

<AI>
I understand that you're feeling worried about your academic performance. It's important to remember that everyone experiences setbacks sometimes. Just because you're not getting the grades you want right now doesn't mean you're not smart enough or that you'll never succeed.

Here are some things you can do to help you feel better about your academic performance:

* **Talk to your teachers and tutors.** They can help you identify areas where you need to improve and give you tips on how to study more effectively.
* **Set realistic goals for yourself.** Don't try to get straight A's if you know that's not realistic for you. Instead, set smaller goals that you can achieve more easily.
* **Take breaks.** It's important to take breaks from studying so that you don't burn yourself out. Make sure to get enough sleep and eat healthy foods.
* **Don't compare yourself to others.** Everyone is different and learns at their own pace. Just because someone else is getting better grades than you doesn't mean you're not smart enough.

Remember, you're not a failure. You're just going through a tough time right now. Keep up the good work and I'm sure you'll eventually see the results you're looking for.

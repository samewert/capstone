How can I overcome it?

<AI>
There are a few things you can do to overcome feeling homesick.

* **Stay connected with your family and friends back home.** This is the most important thing you can do to help yourself feel better. Make sure to call, text, or video chat with your loved ones regularly. Share your experiences with them and let them know how you're feeling. They can provide you with emotional support and help you to stay connected to your roots.
* **Make new friends in your new city.** It's important to build a new social circle in your new city. Try to meet new people through your hobbies, interests, or work. Join a club or group that you're interested in. Volunteer in your community. The more you get involved, the more likely you are to meet people who share your interests and make friends.
* **Explore your new city.** Get out and explore your new city. Find new places to eat, shop, and visit. Take walks or bike rides in your neighborhood. The more you explore, the more you'll start to feel like you belong.
* **Give yourself time.** It takes time to adjust to a new place. Don't expect to feel at home right away. Be patient with yourself and give yourself time to adjust. Eventually, you'll start to feel more comfortable and at home in your new city.

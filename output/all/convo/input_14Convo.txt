<USER>I'm not sure if I'm ready to develop a meal plan yet. I'm really scared of eating more food.
<AI>I understand that you're scared of eating more food. It's a common fear for people with eating disorders. However, it's important to remember that eating more food is necessary for recovery. When you restrict your food intake, your body goes into starvation mode. This means that your metabolism slows down and your body starts to break down muscle tissue for energy. This can lead to a number of health problems, including weight loss, fatigue, and hair loss.

It's also important to remember that eating more food doesn't mean that you're going to gain weight. In fact, when you start to recover from an eating disorder, you may actually lose weight at first. This is because your body is getting rid of the excess water and fat that it stored during the starvation phase.

If you're not ready to develop a meal plan yet, that's okay. You can start by slowly increasing your food intake. Try to eat one or two more meals or snacks each day. You can also try eating more fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. These foods are low in calories and high in nutrients, so they can help you to feel full without gaining weight.

It's also important to remember that recovery is a process. It takes time and effort, but it's worth it. If you're struggling with an eating disorder, please reach out for help. There are people who care about you and want to help you get better.
<USER>Okay. I'm willing to try.

But what can I do to manage my stress?

<AI>
There are a few things you can do to manage your stress about studying abroad.

* **Talk to someone.** Talking about your worries can help you to feel better and to develop strategies for coping with stress. Talk to a friend, family member, therapist, or counselor.
* **Do something you enjoy.** Make time for activities that you enjoy, such as reading, listening to music, or spending time with friends. This will help you to relax and to take your mind off of your worries.
* **Set realistic expectations.** It's important to set realistic expectations for yourself when you're studying abroad. Don't expect to be perfect right away. Everyone makes mistakes when they're first adjusting to a new culture. Just focus on taking things one step at a time and learning from your experiences.
* **Be patient with yourself.** It takes time to adjust to a new culture. Don't be discouraged if you have a few bad days. Just keep at it and you'll eventually start to feel more comfortable.
* **Remember that you're not alone.** There are plenty of other people who have studied abroad and have been through the same thing. Reach out to other students who are studying abroad or talk to your professors or advisors. They can provide you with support and guidance.

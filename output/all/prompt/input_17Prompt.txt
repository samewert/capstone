That's understandable - your parents want what's best for you, and they want you to succeed.

Break your goals down into smaller, more manageable steps. This will make them seem less daunting and more achievable.\n* **Take breaks.** It's important to take breaks throughout the day, especially if you're feeling overwhelmed. Get up and move around, or step outside for some fresh air. Taking a break can help you clear your head and come back to your work refreshed.\n* **Talk to someone you trust.** If you're feeling really stressed, talk to a friend, family member, teacher, or counselor. Talking about your problems can help you feel better and develop strategies for coping with stress.\n* **Remember that you're not alone.** Everyone feels stressed about school sometimes. Just remember that you're not alone, and you're capable of handling whatever comes your way."]'

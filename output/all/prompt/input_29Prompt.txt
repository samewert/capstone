One way is to think about the things you enjoy doing. What activities do you find yourself drawn to? What do you do for fun? Another way to figure out your passion is to think about the things you're good at. What are you naturally talented at? What are you good at that others seem to appreciate? Once you have a few ideas of what you're passionate about, you can start to explore those interests further. You can read books, watch documentaries, or talk to people who are passionate about the same things. You can also try out different activities to see if you enjoy them. The more you explore your interests, the more likely you are to find something that you're passionate about."]'

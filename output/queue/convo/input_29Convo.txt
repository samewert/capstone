I'm worried about disappointing my family and friends if I choose a "safe" major or career path that doesn't fulfill me.

<AI>
It's understandable to be worried about disappointing your family and friends if you choose a major or career path that doesn't fulfill you. However, it's important to remember that you are the one who has to live with your decision, not them. You need to choose a path that you're passionate about and that you believe in. If you're not happy with your career, it will be difficult to be successful.

Of course, you don't want to disappoint your loved ones. But you also don't want to live a life that you're not passionate about. It's important to find a balance between the two.

Here are a few things you can do to address your concerns:

* Talk to your family and friends about your concerns. Let them know that you're trying to make the best decision for yourself, but that you're also worried about disappointing them.
* Explain to them that you need to choose a path that you're passionate about, even if it's not the "safe" choice.
* Ask them to support you in your decision, even if they don't agree with it.
* Remind yourself that you're not responsible for making everyone else happy. You need to make decisions that are right for you.

It's important to remember that you're not alone in this. Many people feel the same way. You just need to find the courage to follow your own path, even if it's not the path that everyone else expects you to take.

<USER>I'm so worried about my future career. I don't know what I want to do with my life, and I'm afraid of making the wrong decision.
<AI>It sounds like you're feeling stressed about your future career. That's understandable - it's a big decision! But don't worry, you're not alone. Many people feel the same way.
<USER>I guess that makes me feel a little better. But I'm still really scared. I don't want to make a decision that I'll regret later.
<AI>I understand your concern. It's important to make a decision that you're happy with, but it's also important to remember that you can always change your mind later on. If you're really struggling to make a decision, you could talk to a career counselor or a trusted friend or family member for some advice.
<USER>But how do I know what I'm passionate about? I've tried so many different things, but nothing really seems to stick.
<AI>That's a great question. There are a few things you can do to try to figure out what you're passionate about. First, you can think about what you enjoy doing in your free time. What activities do you find yourself drawn to? What do you find yourself talking about the most? What makes you feel excited and engaged? Second, you can think about what you're good at. What are your strengths and talents? What are you naturally good at? What do people compliment you on? Third, you can think about what you're interested in. What do you want to learn more about? What do you want to be involved in? What are you curious about? Once you have a better understanding of what you enjoy, what you're good at, and what you're interested in, you can start to narrow down your options for a career.
<USER>Thanks, JOY. That's really helpful. I feel a little bit better now.
<AI>I'm glad I could help. It sounds like you're on the right track. Just remember, you don't have to make a decision right away. Take your time, explore your options, and don't be afraid to change your mind if you need to.

It's understandable to feel homesick sometimes. What about home makes you feel that way?

Yeah, it's just been hard to adjust to my new life here. I miss my family and friends a lot.

It's important to give yourself time to adjust, and to find ways to stay connected with your family and friends back home. There are a lot of ways to do this, like calling them on the phone, texting them, or using social media. You can also find online communities of people who are going through the same thing, which can be a great way to feel supported.

How can I overcome it?

<AI>
It's understandable to feel worried about never feeling at home in a new place. However, it's important to remember that it takes time to adjust to any major change. With time, you will likely start to feel more at home in your new surroundings. In the meantime, there are a few things you can do to help yourself feel more comfortable:

* **Give yourself time to adjust.** It takes time to adjust to any major change, so don't expect to feel at home right away. Be patient with yourself and allow yourself to grieve the loss of your old life.
* **Find ways to stay connected with your family and friends back home.** This could involve calling them on the phone, texting them, or using social media. It's also important to find ways to make new friends in your new city.
* **Focus on the positive aspects of your new life.** There are probably a lot of things that you like about your new life, even if you don't realize it right now. For example, you might be meeting new people, learning new things, or having new experiences. Try to appreciate these things and they might help you to feel more at home.

It's also important to remember that everyone experiences homesickness differently. Some people may feel homesick for a few weeks or months, while others may feel homesick for years. There is no right or wrong way to feel. If you're struggling with homesickness, it's important to talk to someone about it. Your family and friends can provide support and understanding. You can also talk to a therapist or counselor.

I've been thinking about talking to my resident assistant.

They can provide you with information about campus resources, help you connect with other students, and offer emotional support. I encourage you to reach out to your resident assistant and let them know how you're feeling.

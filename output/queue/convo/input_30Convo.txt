I'm really stressed about thinking about post-graduation life.

<AI>
It's understandable to be stressed about post-graduation life. It's a big change, and there's a lot to think about. But don't worry, you're not alone. Many people feel the same way.

<USER>
Yeah, but I feel like everyone else has their life together. They know what they want to do and where they want to go. I'm just kind of lost.

<AI>
I understand how you feel. It can be tough to see everyone else moving on with their lives and feel like you're the only one who's not sure what they want to do. But the truth is, most people are just as lost as you are. They just might not be showing it.

<USER>
But I feel so much pressure to have it all figured out.

It's okay to not have it all figured out. In fact, it's more common than you think. The important thing is to take your time and figure out what's right for you. There's no rush.

<USER>
I guess so. But it's hard not to worry about the future.

I guess I could start by making a list of my goals and then developing a plan to achieve them.

<AI>
That's a great idea! Making a list of your goals and developing a plan to achieve them can help you stay focused and motivated. It can also help you to track your progress and see how you're doing.

<USER>
Thanks, JOY. I feel a little better already.

<AI>
You're welcome! I'm glad I could help. It sounds like you're on the right track. Making a list of your goals and developing a plan to achieve them is a great way to start taking control of your life and moving towards the things you want. Just remember to take your time and don't be afraid to make adjustments along the way. There's no one-size-fits-all approach to life, so what works for someone else might not work for you. The important thing is to find what works for you and to keep moving forward.

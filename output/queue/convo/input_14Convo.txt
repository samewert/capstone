<AI>I understand that you're scared of eating more food. It's a common fear for people with eating disorders. However, it's important to remember that eating more food is necessary for recovery. When you restrict your food intake, your body goes into starvation mode. This means that your metabolism slows down and your body starts to break down muscle tissue for energy. This can lead to a number of health problems, including fatigue, weakness, and hair loss. It can also make it difficult to recover from your eating disorder.

I know it's hard to take that first step, but it's important to start eating more food. You can start by slowly increasing your food intake by a few hundred calories each day. It's also important to eat a variety of healthy foods, including fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.

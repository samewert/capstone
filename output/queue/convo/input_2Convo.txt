I'm feeling really stressed about not fitting in at college. I feel like I don't belong here.

It's understandable to feel stressed about not fitting in at college. College can be a big adjustment, and it can take time to find your place. It's important to remember that you're not alone in feeling this way. Many students feel the same way when they first start college.

Here are some things you can do to help you feel more at home at college:

* **Talk to your professors and classmates.** Get to know people in your classes and your professors. The more people you know, the more likely you are to find people you connect with.
* **Join a club or organization.** This is a great way to meet people who share your interests. There are clubs and organizations for just about everything, so you're sure to find something that you're interested in.
* **Get involved in your community.** Volunteer your time or attend community events. This is a great way to meet people and give back to your community.
* **Be yourself.** Don't try to be someone you're not. The more you try to be someone you're not, the more likely you are to feel like you don't belong. Just be yourself and you'll eventually find your place.

Well, I don't seem to have anything in common with the other students. They're all so popular and outgoing, and I'm just not. I feel like I'm always on the outside looking in.

I understand how you feel. It can be tough to feel like you don't fit in, especially when everyone else seems to be so different from you. But it's important to remember that you're not alone in feeling this way. Many students feel the same way when they first start college.

I know it's not easy, but try not to compare yourself to other students. Everyone is different, and there's no one right way to fit in. Just focus on being yourself and doing the things you love. Eventually, you'll find your place.

I know, but it's hard not to compare myself to others. Everyone seems to have so many friends, and I'm just lonely.

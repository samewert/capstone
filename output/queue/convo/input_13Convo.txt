JOY, I'm feeling really stressed about my future career path. I'm going to graduate in a few months, and I still don't know what I want to do with my life.

It sounds like you're feeling stressed about your future career path. I can understand why - it's a big decision, and it's one that you don't want to make wrong. But don't worry, you're not alone. Many people feel the same way when they're about to graduate.

I know, but it's starting to feel like everyone else knows what they're doing except for me. All of my friends have job offers already, and I'm still lost.

I know it can be tough to feel like you're the only one who's not sure what they want to do with their life. But I can assure you that you're not alone. Many people feel the same way when they're about to graduate. It's a big decision, and it's one that you don't want to make wrong. But don't worry, you're not going to make a wrong decision. Just take your time, explore your options, and eventually you'll find something that you're passionate about.

<USER>
But how do I know what I'm passionate about?

<AI>
That's a great question. There are a few ways to figure out what you're passionate about. One way is to think about the things you enjoy doing in your free time. What activities do you find yourself drawn to? What do you find yourself talking about the most? Another way to figure out your passion is to think about the things you're good at. What are you naturally talented at? What are you good at that others seem to appreciate? Once you have a few ideas of what you're passionate about, you can start to explore those interests further. You can read books, watch documentaries, or talk to people who are already working in those fields. The more you learn about your interests, the more you'll be able to narrow down your options and find something that you're truly passionate about.

<AI>I understand that you're feeling held back by your self-doubt. It's common to feel afraid to try new things when you're worried about failing.

<USER>But it's hard not to compare myself to others. Everyone else seems to have their lives together, and I'm just struggling to keep up.
<AI>I understand that it can be difficult to see others who seem to have their lives together when you're struggling to keep up. It's important to remember that everyone is different, and we all have our own unique strengths and weaknesses. Just because someone else seems to have it all together doesn't mean that you don't. You are unique and special in your own way, and you have a lot to offer the world.

One of the things that you can do to overcome this feeling is to stop comparing yourself to others. It's easy to fall into the trap of comparing ourselves to others, but it's important to remember that this is often a recipe for disaster. When we compare ourselves to others, we're only setting ourselves up for disappointment. We're never going to be perfect, and we're never going to be able to do everything that everyone else does. So instead of comparing ourselves to others, we need to focus on our own unique strengths and weaknesses. We need to focus on our own goals and accomplishments. When we focus on our own journey, we're less likely to feel like we're not good enough.

Another thing that you can do is to surround yourself with positive people who believe in you. These people can help you to see your own worth and to appreciate your own unique talents. They can also help you to stay focused on your goals and to overcome any challenges that you face.

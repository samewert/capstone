I've tried some relaxation techniques, but I haven't been consistent with them. I guess I don't always make time for them.

I understand that it can be difficult to make time for relaxation, especially when you're feeling stressed. However, it's important to take some time for yourself to de-stress and recharge. There are a number of things you can do to relax, such as:

* **Taking a bath or shower.** The warm water can help to soothe your muscles and relax your mind.
* **Listening to calming music.** Music can help to lower your heart rate and blood pressure, and promote relaxation.
* **Reading a book.** Reading can help to take your mind off of your worries and stressors.
* **Spending time in nature.** Spending time in nature can help to reduce stress and improve your mood.
* **Getting enough sleep.** When you're sleep-deprived, you're more likely to feel stressed and anxious. Make sure you're getting at least 7-8 hours of sleep each night.

I have a few close friends, but I haven't told them about my substance abuse. I'm afraid they'll think I'm a bad person.

<AI>
I understand that you're afraid of what your friends might think of you if they knew about your substance abuse. It's a common fear, and it's understandable. However, it's important to remember that your friends care about you, and they're unlikely to think badly of you if they knew about your struggles. In fact, they might be able to offer you support and help you get through this difficult time.

If you're not ready to tell your friends about your substance abuse, that's okay. You can still talk to a therapist or counselor about it. They can help you to deal with your addiction and develop coping mechanisms. There are also a number of support groups available for people who are struggling with substance abuse.

If you're not sure where to find a therapist, you can ask your doctor for a referral. You can also search online for therapists in your area.

It's important to find a therapist who you feel comfortable with and who understands your needs. Once you've found a therapist, you can start working on your recovery. Therapy can be a long and difficult process, but it's worth it to get your life back on track.

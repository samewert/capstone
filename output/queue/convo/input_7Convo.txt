I'm always comparing myself to other people, and I never feel good enough. I feel like I'm too fat, too skinny, too short, too tall.

I understand that you're struggling with body image issues. It's a common problem, and it's important to know that you're not alone. Many people feel the same way you do. It's easy to compare yourself to others and feel like you're not good enough, but it's important to remember that everyone is different and there is no one "right" way to look. You are beautiful just the way you are.

<USER>
I know, but it's hard not to. I'm constantly seeing images of people who are considered to be beautiful, and I don't feel like I fit in.

I understand that it can be difficult to avoid comparing yourself to others, especially when you're constantly seeing images of people who are considered to be beautiful. It's important to remember that everyone is different and that there is no one "right" way to look. You are beautiful just the way you are.

It's also important to remember that the images of people who are considered to be beautiful are often edited and airbrushed to make them look perfect. This can create an unrealistic expectation of beauty that can be difficult to live up to. It's important to remember that these images are not real and that you should not compare yourself to them.

If you're struggling with body image issues, it's important to talk to someone who can help you. A therapist can help you to develop a healthier body image and to learn how to cope with the challenges of living in a society that values thinness and beauty.

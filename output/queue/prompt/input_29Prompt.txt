I've tried so many different things, but nothing really seems to stick.", "<Bot> That's a great question. There are a few things you can do to try to figure out what you're passionate about. First, you can think about what you enjoy doing in your free time. What activities do you find yourself drawn to? What do you find yourself talking about the most? What makes you feel excited and engaged? Second, you can think about what you're good at. What are your strengths and talents? What are you naturally good at? What do people compliment you on? Third, you can think about what you're interested in. What do you want to learn more about? What do you want to be involved in? What are you curious about? Once you have a better understanding of what you enjoy, what you're good at, and what you're interested in, you can start to narrow down your options for a career."]'

Talk to your classmates, watch movies and TV shows in your target language, and listen to music.\n\nFinally, let's talk about making new friends. This can be the hardest part of studying abroad, but it's also the most rewarding. The best way to make friends is to put yourself out there and get involved in activities. Join a club or sports team, volunteer in your community, or just go out and meet people.\n\nI know you're capable of handling this challenge.

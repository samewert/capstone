Student: I'm feeling really stressed about my academic performance. My parents have really high expectations for me, and I'm afraid of letting them down.
JOY: It's understandable that you're feeling stressed. Parents often have high expectations for their children, especially when it comes to academics. But it's important to remember that you're your own person, and you don't have to be perfect.
Student: I know, but it's hard. My parents are always asking me about my grades and my classes. They want me to go to a top law school, and I'm not sure if I'm good enough.
JOY: It's important to communicate with your parents about how you're feeling. Let them know that you appreciate their support, but that you also need to be realistic about your goals and abilities. It's also important to set realistic goals for yourself. Don't try to be perfect or to achieve the impossible. Instead, focus on setting small, achievable goals for yourself. This will help you to feel more in control of your situation and less stressed about meeting expectations.
Student: I guess I can try that. But I'm still worried about letting my parents down.
JOY: It's understandable to feel that way. But it's important to remember that your parents love you and support you no matter what. They want what's best for you, even if they don't always know how to show it. If you're feeling overwhelmed by their expectations, please reach out for help. There are many resources available to you, such as counseling services and academic support programs.
Student: Thank you, JOY. I really appreciate your advice.
JOY: You're welcome. I'm here for you if you need anything.
